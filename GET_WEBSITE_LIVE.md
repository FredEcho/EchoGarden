# 🌐 Get Your EchoGarden Website Live on GitHub Pages

## Current Issue
You can access the GitHub repository page, but the actual website isn't accessible. This means GitHub Pages isn't properly configured yet.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Settings
1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/FredEcho/EchoGarden
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (at the top of the repository page)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Trigger the GitHub Actions Workflow
The workflow should automatically run when you push to the `feature` branch. If it hasn't run yet:

1. **Go to the "Actions" tab** in your repository
2. **Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages"** workflow
3. **If it's not running, click "Run workflow"** and select the `feature` branch

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- **GitHub Actions takes 2-5 minutes** to build and deploy
- **Check the Actions tab** to see the progress
- **Look for a green checkmark** when it's complete

### Step 4: Access Your Website
Once deployment is complete, your website will be available at:
**https://fredecho.github.io/EchoGarden/**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the website still doesn't work:

#### Check 1: GitHub Actions Status
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Look for any **red X marks** or error messages
4. If there are errors, they'll tell you what's wrong

#### Check 2: GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Make sure **Source** is set to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. If it says "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

#### Check 3: Build Output
The workflow should create a `gh-pages` branch with your built website files. If this branch doesn't exist, the deployment failed.

#### Check 4: URL Format
Make sure you're using the correct URL format:
- ✅ **Correct**: `https://fredecho.github.io/EchoGarden/`
- ❌ **Wrong**: `https://fredecho.github.io/EchoGarden` (missing trailing slash)

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "404 Not Found"
- **Cause**: GitHub Pages not configured or deployment failed
- **Solution**: Follow Steps 1-3 above

### Issue 2: "Page not found" or shows README
- **Cause**: GitHub Pages serving from wrong source
- **Solution**: Set Source to "GitHub Actions" in Settings → Pages

### Issue 3: Website loads but looks broken
- **Cause**: Build failed or wrong base path
- **Solution**: Check Actions logs for build errors

### Issue 4: Actions workflow not running
- **Cause**: Workflow file issues or branch problems
- **Solution**: 
  1. Make sure you're on the `feature` branch
  2. Push a small change to trigger the workflow
  3. Check the workflow file syntax

## 📞 Quick Fix Commands

If you need to trigger the deployment manually:

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger the workflow
echo "# Trigger deployment" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin feature
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After following these steps:
1. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
2. ✅ Creates a `gh-pages` branch with built files
3. ✅ Website accessible at `https://fredecho.github.io/EchoGarden/`
4. ✅ Shows your EchoGarden application (not README)

## 📱 Test Your Website

Once live, test these features:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] All pages are accessible
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

Your website should be live within 5-10 minutes of completing these steps!

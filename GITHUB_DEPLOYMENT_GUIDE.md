# 🚀 Complete GitHub Deployment Guide for EchoGarden

This guide will help you properly upload your EchoGarden project to GitHub and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Git installed on your computer
- GitHub account
- PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Initial Setup (One-time only)

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Frederic De Waege\Desktop\echogarden\echo code\echo unzip\EchoGarden"
   ```

2. **Check git status:**
   ```powershell
   git status
   ```

3. **Add all files:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit changes:**
   ```powershell
   git commit -m "Initial EchoGarden deployment setup"
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```powershell
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy.ps1
   ```

2. **Wait for the build to complete** (2-3 minutes)

3. **Check the Actions tab** in your GitHub repository to see the deployment progress

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository:** https://github.com/FredEcho/EchoGarden
2. **Click "Settings" tab**
3. **Scroll down to "Pages" section**
4. **Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"**
5. **Save the changes**

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update
2. **Visit your website:** https://fredecho.github.io/EchoGarden/
3. **You should see the EchoGarden landing page** instead of the README

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see the README instead of your website:

1. **Check GitHub Pages settings:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Make sure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - If it's set to "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Check the Actions tab:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Make sure it completed successfully

3. **Manual deployment (if needed):**
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy-to-github-pages.ps1
   ```

### If the deployment fails:

1. **Check for errors in the Actions tab**
2. **Make sure all files are committed:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Try manual deployment:**
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy-to-github-pages.ps1
   ```
